# ChatAGH

This project implements an advanced **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, serving as the backend for the **ChatAGH** project. Its primary goal is to generate contextually relevant, accurate, and meaningful responses to user queries by combining the strengths of LLM agents with **graph-based** knowledge retrieval.

Unlike standard RAG systems that rely solely on vector-based retrieval, this project leverages both vector and graph-structured data to enrich the context. By modeling relationships between e
ntities and concepts in a knowledge graph, the system can:
- Provide deeper contextual understanding for complex queries
- Connect related pieces of information that may be distributed across multiple sources
- Enhance reasoning by capturing dependencies and hierarchies within the data
